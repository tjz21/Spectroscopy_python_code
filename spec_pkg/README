Current work in progress:

1) Morse oscillator module
- FC based linear spectroscopy (harmonic expansion of PES)
- computing autocorrelation functions (exact and classical)
- Nonlinear spectroscopy (exact and cumulant based approaches)

2) nonlinear spectroscopy
- Implement more nonlinear spectroscopy approaches
